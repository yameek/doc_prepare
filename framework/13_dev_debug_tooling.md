# 13. Dev / Debug Tooling

A good developer is a lazy developer. Use tools to automate the boring stuff and find bugs faster.

## Junior -> Mid: The Basics
**Goal:** Efficient local development workflow.

### 1. Hot Reloading
- **Concept:** See changes instantly.
- **Key Skills:**
    - Configuring tools like `nodemon`, `Spring Boot DevTools`, or `Air` to restart the server when files change.

### 2. Interactive Debugging
- **Concept:** Stop guessing with `print` statements.
- **Key Skills:**
    - Attaching a debugger (VS Code, IntelliJ) to the running process.
    - Setting Breakpoints.
    - Inspecting variables and the Call Stack.

## Mid -> Senior: Introspection
**Goal:** Understanding what the code is actually doing at runtime.

### 1. SQL Profiling
- **Concept:** Why is this page slow?
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - **Query Logging:** Enabling logs to see the raw SQL generated by the ORM.
    - **Explain Analyze:** Understanding how the DB executes a query (Index Scan vs Seq Scan).

### 2. API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **Concept:** Live documentation.
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - **Auto-generation:** Generating `swagger.json` from your code/annotations.
    - **Swagger UI:** Providing a web interface for other devs to try out your API.

### 3. Linters & Formatters
- **Concept:** Enforcing style.
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - **Pre-commit Hooks:** Running ESLint/Prettier/Black before allowing a commit.
    - **Static Analysis:** Catching potential bugs (e.g., unused variables, unreachable code) without running the app.

## Senior -> Lead: Developer Experience (DX)
**Goal:** Optimizing the workflow for the entire team.

### 1. Remote Debugging & Telepresence
- **Concept:** Debugging in the cloud.
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - **Remote Attach:** Debugging a process running in a Docker container or Kubernetes pod.
    - **Telepresence:** Proxying traffic from a remote cluster to your local laptop to debug a service in the context of the full system.

### 2. Profiling & Flame Graphs
- **Concept:** Finding CPU/Memory leaks.
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - **CPU Profiling:** Sampling the stack 1000 times/sec to see which functions consume the most CPU.
    - **Heap Dumps:** Analyzing memory usage to find objects that aren't being garbage collected.

### 3. Custom CLI Tools
- **Concept:** Automating team tasks.
- **Key Knowledge:**
    - Building custom scripts (e.g., `npm run db:reset` or `make deploy-staging`) to standardize common operations.
